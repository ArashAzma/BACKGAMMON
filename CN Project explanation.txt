Project explanation:

Implementation of the Game "تخته نرد" in a 1v1 network computer. The two players are connected using P2P and play, chat together and there is Main Server.
The Main server connects the players together but no one has the address of the main server and connection of players is made using *Onion Routing*.

Start of Game:

A player makes an request to the server. The server shows the active players whom already showed that they are ready to play. 
When user enters the address of the second player, The server assigns a socket to this player and after getting the accept message from the second player The game starts.
After this the players play the game together. after each turn the player whose Its his turn, sends a message to the server.
The server rolls the dice and tells the server the number of the dice. the other player doesn't know the number of the dice.
The players can chat to each other but the server cant read the chats.
At the end the player that ended the game sends an End message to the server, the server checks if the player has ended the game or not and ends it.
the two players can play again if they want with the previous addresses.

* The players dont directly send messages to server and they send messages to an identified router.
